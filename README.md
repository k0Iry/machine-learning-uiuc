## Course Information:
The goal of Machine Learning is to build computer systems that can adapt and learn from data. In this course we will cover three main areas: 

1. **Discriminative models**
1. **Generative models**
1. **Reinforcement learning models**

In particular we will cover the following: 

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Deep Nets
- Structured Methods
- Learning Theory
- kMeans
- Gaussian Mixtures
- Expectation Maximization
- Markov Decision Processes
- Q-Learning

## Pre-requisites: 
Probability, Linear Algebra, and proficiency in Python.
